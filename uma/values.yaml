# HttpProxy connection properties The agentManager.httpProxy properties are used
# only when the Agent is tunneling over HTTP and the Agent must connect to the
# Enterprise Manager through a proxy server (forward proxy). Uncomment and set
# the appropriate proxy host and port values. If the proxy server cannot be
# reached at the specified host and port, the Agent will try a direct HTTP
# tunneled connection to the Enterprise Manager before failing the connection
# attempt.
